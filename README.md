Hi there! I'm **Austin** — part car builder, part traveler, and a UX designer in the making.  
I’m currently working on my BS in Human Systems Engineering with a concentration in UX.
My goal is to transition into the UX department at my current company and apply what I’m learning to improve user experiences.
