Hi there! I'm **Austin** — part car builder, part traveler, and a UX designer in the making.  
I’m currently working on my BS in Human Systems Engineering with a concentration in UX.
My goal is to transition into the UX department at my current company and apply what I’m learning to improve user experiences.
I enjoy coding when I can actually see my work come to life, like building something that looks good and works well for the user.
My technical skills are still growing, but I know the basics of HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I’m also getting better at using Figma for design work
